## Methodology
We analysed a small collection of chess positions to explore which white piece combinations most frequently lead to checkmate. Positions were sourced from repository test data and a few curated mating patterns. For each position we recorded whether it was a mate and the presence of major/minor pieces.

A logistic regression model was built to estimate the probability of checkmate given the presence of queens, rooks, bishops, and knights. Due to the unavailable R runtime in the environment, coefficients were computed using a lightweight Python implementation of logistic regression. The final weights are stored in `analysis/synergy.json`.

## Model summary
```{r}
library(jsonlite)
synergy <- fromJSON("../analysis/synergy.json")
synergy$pair_counts
synergy$logistic_regression$predicted_probabilities
```

## Example checkmate scenario
An example where coordinated pieces deliver checkmate:

| FEN | Attacking pieces |
|-----|-----------------|
| `7k/5Q1R/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1` | King, Queen, Rook |

This position shows a typical mating net where the queen and rook restrict the opposing king's escape squares while the king provides support.
