"""Reusable tactical guardrails for candidate move filtering.

This module provides a small set of safety checks intended to prevent
obvious tactical blunders during candidate move selection:

- Legality/sanity: verify the move is legal in the current position
- 1â€“2 ply blunder check: shallow material-only search to catch simple
  blunders using :class:`RiskAnalyzer`
- High-value hang filter: avoid moves that place high-value pieces on
  squares where they are immediately under-defended

The checks are intentionally lightweight and deterministic. The module is
meant to be used by selectors/orchestrators before running expensive search
or evaluation.
