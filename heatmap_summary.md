# Chess Game Heatmap Analysis

## Game Information
- **Event**: Viewer
- **Site**: Local
- **White**: DynamicBot
- **Black**: FortifyBot
- **Result**: 1/2-1/2 (Draw)

## Heatmap Generation Success

The heatmap generation has been successfully completed despite the initial R dependency issue. A Python-based solution was created to generate heatmaps without requiring R installation.

## Key Findings

### Move Frequency by Piece
1. **q (Black Queen)**: 11 moves - Most active piece
2. **p (Black Pawns)**: 10 moves
3. **R (White Rooks)**: 10 moves
4. **P (White Pawns)**: 9 moves
5. **r (Black Rooks)**: 4 moves
6. **Q (White Queen)**: 3 moves
7. **K (White King)**: 2 moves
8. **B (White Bishops)**: 2 moves
9. **n (Black Knights)**: 2 moves
10. **N (White Knights)**: 2 moves

### Most Active Squares
1. **d7**: 6 moves (Black Queen)
2. **f1**: 5 moves (White Rook)
3. **e1**: 4 moves (White Rook)
4. **e7**: 4 moves (Black Queen)
5. **e2**: 2 moves (White Queen)

### Game Characteristics
- **Total Moves**: 55 moves
- **Game Type**: Draw (1/2-1/2)
- **Most Active Area**: Center and back ranks
- **Queen Activity**: Both queens were very active, especially Black's queen on d7
- **Rook Activity**: White rooks were very active on the first rank (e1, f1)

## Files Generated
- Individual piece heatmaps (JSON format)
- Combined heatmap visualization
- Text-based heatmap display
- Game analysis summary

## Technical Solution
Since R was not available in the environment, a Python-based heatmap generator was created that:
1. Parses PGN notation manually
2. Tracks piece movements
3. Generates 8x8 heatmap grids for each piece type
4. Provides both JSON data and visual text representations
5. Analyzes game patterns and statistics

The solution successfully bypassed the R dependency while providing comprehensive heatmap analysis of the chess game.
