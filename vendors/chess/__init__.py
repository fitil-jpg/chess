"""Stub module for the optional :mod:`python-chess` dependency.

This repository avoids bundling heavy thirdâ€‘party libraries.  When the
real ``python-chess`` package is unavailable, importing this stub allows the
test suite to gracefully skip any tests that depend on it.

Accessing any attribute of this module triggers a ``pytest.skip`` so that
tests using :mod:`chess` are reported as skipped rather than failing with an
``ImportError`` or ``AttributeError``.

Outside of ``pytest`` (for example, when running project scripts manually),
attempting to use this stub will raise ``ImportError`` to clearly signal the
missing dependency.
